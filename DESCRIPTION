Description: Provides modular, graph-based agents powered by large language models ('LLMs') for intelligent task execution in R.
    Supports structured workflows for 'forecasting', 'data visualization', 'feature engineering', 'data wrangling',
    'data cleaning', 'SQL', 'code generation', 'weather reporting', and research-driven question answering.
    Each agent performs iterative reasoning: recommending steps, generating R code, executing, debugging, and explaining results.
    Includes built-in support for 'tidymodels', 'modeltime', 'plotly', 'ggplot2', 'prophet', and more.
    Designed for analysts, developers, and teams building intelligent, reproducible AI workflows in R.
    Compatible with 'LLM' providers such as 'OpenAI' (<https://openai.com>), 'Anthropic' (<https://www.anthropic.com/>),
    'Groq' (<https://groq.com>), and 'Ollama' (<https://ollama.com>). Inspired by the 'python' package 'langagent'
    (<https://pypi.org/project/langagent/>).
